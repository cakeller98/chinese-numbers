"""
__init__.py - Package Marker (Poetry 2.0+, src layout)

This file marks this directory as a Python package.

For most projects, leave this file empty.

Rare use cases:
- Expose selected submodules or symbols for import (e.g. `from chinese_numbers import foo`)
- Set up package-level constants, configuration, or logging
- Perform package-level initialization (rare; not recommended)
- Import dependencies required by all submodules

Poetry 2.x uses the /src/package structure for better isolation and builds.
Python 3.10-3.13 recommended.
